# Jack Retterer's Portfolio Website

Welcome to the public GitHub repository for my personal portfolio website. This site showcases my projects, experiences, and interests in the field of technology, particularly in crypto, AI, and space. I built the site with React and hosted it on Vercel.

## Website URL

[jackretterer.xyz](https://jackretterer.xyz)

## About The Project

The landing page of this portfolio is designed to provide a comprehensive view of my professional and personal journey. The website is structured to highlight my projects, work experience, and areas of interest.

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Material-UI](https://mui.com/)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for Hosting
- [Dalle3](https://chat.openai.com/) for Icons

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have npm installed:
```bash
npm install npm@latest -g


## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/jackretterer/portfolio.git
2. Install NPM packages from the root directory
npm install
3. To start the project locally in your browser:
npm start

* By default this will run the site on http://localhost:3000

Deployment
The website is deployed on Vercel. To deploy your own version:

1. Push your code changes to your repository.
2. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.
3. Follow the Vercel deployment prompts to deploy your site. Sometimes you will encounter some issues with building the site on Vercel. Often it comes down to library dependency conflicts.

I also bought the domain on Namescheap. I used Dalle 3 for the icons.
